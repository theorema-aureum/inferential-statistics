# inferential-statistics
A code repository for my project for the completion of the Duke University Data Analysis with R Specialization - Inferential Statistics certificate hosted by Coursera.

Below is the project description from Coursera: "For this summary project, you’ll need to utilize all the skills you’ve gained throughout the duration of this course. In this project, you will identify a research question similar to questions we’ve talked about in this course. Use the General Social Survey (GSS) dataset (provided in the prior reading)."

This repository includes the dataset as a CSV file and my completed exploratory data analysis as an R Markdown file.
